# Ramen God üçúüêµ
## A New Take on an Old Poster
A few years ago, I drew a big, chaotic poster of a monkey god making ramen for the kitchen in our old, shared student flat:

</p>  
It was wild, expressive, and full of motion ‚Äî fitting for that time and place. For our new place, I wanted something more structured, bold, and clean. Still fun, but with a clearer design language. Same theme, new direction.

## Rough Sketches & New Focus
The new version keeps the monkey, but strips away the chaos.. One centered figure, calm and focused, slurping ramen in peace.

</p>  
I started with a rough pencil layout, loosely inspired by the old piece, but more symmetrical and iconographic. The ingredients float like diagram elements around him.

## Linework, Color, and Rhythm
Once the sketch was solid, I cleaned up the linework and tested basic color blocking to define the structure.

Then came the full color pass ‚Äî layered up from flat fills to high contrast accents. The background teal was a late addition but helped the piece snap. Patterns in the jacket, the ramen bowl, and the ingredient packaging were stylized to give it more rhythm and texture.

## The Final Piece

I'm very happy with how it turned out. It captures the essence of the original while feeling fresh and new. The monkey god is still there‚Äîjust a little more refined, a little more zen. Perfect for our kitchen wall.
